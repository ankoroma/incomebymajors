            <p>
                <b>Analysis</b>: Coming out of school, Physician's Assistants had very high salaries, followed by engineering degrees.
Nursing also seems higher than one might expect. Next come majors such as Business Management, Political
Science, Marketing. At the bottom, we have the art majors: Music, Drama, Art, followed by Education,
Religion, and Spanish at the bottom.

            <p>
                <b>Analysis</b>: For Figure 2, I sorted by the (median) mid-career salary to see the changes in salary and identify
                potential shifts in top earning majors. We will also have the median starting salary as a benchmark of potential
                interest. Looking at the graph, we see that the Physicians Assistants, Nursing, and Nutrition majors have fallen
                in the rankings. Top money makers (by mid-career salaries) are the engineering majors, with Chemical
                Engineering at the top.

            <p>
                <b>Analysis</b>: Next, I sorted by the 75th percentile salary to see any further shifts in the top earner(s). We can now
                see that Economic majors are the top earners in the 75th percentile. Also, we see that engineering majors are
                still top earners while business majors (like Finance & Marketing) are climbing the ladder!

            <p>
                <b>Analysis</b>: Finally, I got rid of the starting salary. We'll be looking at the mid-career salaries (by 90th percentile),
                since I think those are more important beyond this point. So now we have a graph that gives, by major,
                the 10th, 25th, median, 75th, and 90th, mid-career earnings. Again, we see the Engineering Majors (along w/
                econ majors) as the top money makers.

                Overall Analysis of Figure 1 - 4:
            </h5>
            <p>
                On a general scale, looking at the medians, it seems that most people will make between 50K and 100K annual
salary mid-way through their careers. For the top performers (75th pct), that range would be between 75K and
125K. Very top performers (90th pct.) will bring home between 100K and 200K yearly.<br><br>
It is interesting that some majors have pretty conservative ranges of salary -- Physician's Assistants and Nursing
majors.<br><br>
In some the arts majors of Music and Drama, the very top performers do very well -- the top 10% performers
(musicians, actors) do very well, making even more money than the top 25% of performers in the
engineering/math/science majors.<br><br>
The people who make the very most money, regarding the top 10% of performers, are Economics and Finance
majors. That makes sense as their job is working with and analyzing money. Another strong performer, again, is
Chemical Engineering.
