            Wondering if that Philosophy major will really help you pay the bills? Think you're set with an Engineering degree? 
            Choosing a college major is a complex decision evaluating personal interest, difficulty, and career prospects.
            Consequently, the discussion about potential earnings following graduation is very common among college students. Like me,
            fellow students also weigh the cost-benefit ratio of their major after graduation, especially with the loans we
            accumulate.<br><br>Therefore, I’d like to explore the <b>variations in salaries of different college degrees</b> across the United States.
            I’m mainly interested in visualizing the <b>majors/fields that give the greatest or least return in investment</b>, but
            it’s also fascinating to see potential jobs that are related to one’s major and how salaries change as one moves
            further in their specialized field of study.<br><br>Whether you're in school or navigating the postgrad world, join me 
            as we explore the short and long term financial implications of this <i>major</i> decision.
