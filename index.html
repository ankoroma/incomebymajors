            Big Idea
        </h2>
        <p>
            Wondering if that Philosophy major will really help you pay the bills? Think you're set with an Engineering degree? 
            Choosing a college major is a complex decision evaluating personal interest, difficulty, and career prospects.
            Consequently, the discussion about potential earnings following graduation is very common among college students. Like me,
            fellow students also weigh the cost-benefit ratio of their major after graduation, especially with the loans we
            accumulate.<br><br>Therefore, I’d like to explore the <b>variations in salaries of different college degrees</b> across the United States.
            I’m mainly interested in visualizing the <b>majors/fields that give the greatest or least return in investment</b>, but
            it’s also fascinating to see potential jobs that are related to one’s major and how salaries change as one moves
            further in their specialized field of study.<br><br>Whether you're in school or navigating the postgrad world, join me 
            as we explore the short and long term financial implications of this <i>major</i> decision.

            Research Questions & Methods
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="bold">How does income vary across different college majors in the US?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>How does it vary over time, across regions, and among college types (private, public, ivy leagues)?</li>
                <br>
                <li>To do this, we will take a look at the starting median income and mid-career median income<br>
                    (also upper percentiles earnings) for several college majors, in various regions and college types.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li class="bold">Are there any majors or colleges that link to specific job sectors?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>While several majors link to specific jobs, it's also common for college graduates to work in fields<br>
                    that are completely unrelated to their major, so it’d be interesting to see this distinction in my visualizations.</li>
                <br>
                <li>To answer this, I will take a look at some survey data from people in various fields. Once I have<br> the data, I’ll
                    incorporate the NetworkX library from python or R to visualize the network that exists between majors and
                    jobs.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Alternatively, if I'm able to find a suitable dataset, we will take a look at a sankey plot possibly <br>for who ends up in what sector.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

            About Data
        </h2>
        <p>In this report, we'll be using data collected from a year-long survey of 1.2 million people with only a bachelor's degree by PayScale Inc., made available 
            <a href="https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-Degrees_that_Pay_you_Back-sort.html" target="_blank">here</a> by the Wall Street Journal for their article 
            <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121746658635199271" target="_blank">Ivy League's Big Edge: Starting Pay</a>. After doing some data clean up, we'll compare the salaries over time (i.e., earning percentiles).
